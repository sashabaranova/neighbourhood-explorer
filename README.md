# Neigbourhood Explorer App

This is a prototype single-page React app created for the Udacity FEND Nanodegree.
It welcomes you into Singapore and provides information about some landmarks.

You can choose from several categories to sort the landmarks according to your interest.

On clickinf a marker or landmark name you will get a beautiful [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) picture and a short description from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/) with a link to the whole article.

Hope you'll enjoy learning about Singapore!
